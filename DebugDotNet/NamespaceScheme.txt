Namespace DebugDotNet
	Contains the Thin wrapper for the MSDN Debug Api in Win32DebugApi static class. The NativeMethods static class is here too.

NameSpace DebugDotNet.Win32.Resources

Namsspace DebugDotNet.NativeHelpers.XXXX
	TODO: Each namespace here corpsonds to a single dll in the same folder location as debugdotnet
NameSpace DebugDotNet.Win32.Enums
	A majority of project specific enums go here. A view class specific ones are defined within their respective class.

Namespace DebugDotnet.Diver
	This is built using Detours. It's a dll that is injected into a process to debug (must be a new one).
	The Dll communicates with the debugger by Raising Exceptions via Structured Excetopion Handling.
	The Namespace in DebugDotNet is code to translate and parse those

Namespace DebugNotNet.Win32.InternalStructs
	The structs that the c# friendly ones are made from are defined in this namespace
	Each one's name scheme is a direct lift from the MSDN equivlenet struct with _INTERNAL at the end.
	A majority of them are marked internal.
	
Namespace DebugDotNet.Win32.Structs
	The c# friendly structs (one with some processing) are here. Strings are read and converted to c# unicode strings and file handles are swapped
	to SafeFileHandle. They are named with CamalCasing.

Namespace DebugDotNet.Tools
	Misc tools here. Notable the UnmanagedToolKit static class the DebugEvent structs use are here.

Namespace DebugDotNet.Win32.Debugger
	Contains higher abstraction of the Debugger api.  See EventDebugger and DebugEventWorkerThread
