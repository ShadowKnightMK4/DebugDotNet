DebugDotNet uses a Hybrid approach to Licensing.

The Dividing line is the DiverDLL, it's code generation software, the C# native stuff to talk with it. 

Outside of the Diver Stuff, the License is MIT.

Inside of the DiverStuff, the License is modified.


The DiverApiCodeGen and DiverApiCodeGenLibrary require a license fee if you wish to include them in a final product.
Code Generated by them however, does not require the fee.

The Diver Protocol can be used Freely and modified as long as it is planly marked that the protocol is altered.
The C# code that allows the diver to talk with a debugger and back follows this same requirement.


In short, DebugDotNet's reason to being made is that it's to be an easy way to handle talking to the Diver Dll and back.
DebugDotNet is under the MIT license.

While the DiverDLL, it's code generation and the C# code that is built on DebugDotNet is a part of the library. I wish to 
reserve the right to monetize my implementation of the DiverDLL and codegen.
