# DebugDotNet
Bringing Win32 DEBUG_EVENT handling to c#


This in intended to be a stand alone version of something I toy with from time to time.  Started with looking at the pinvoke for various parts of the Windows Debugger Routines and structs on pinvoke.net and that included some example code on how to read the DebugEvent structure and introduced me to the world of Marshaling from Windows Native back to .NET. If you're looking for a quick jump into using part of the Windows Debugger things, this as a goal is also intended to be that.
